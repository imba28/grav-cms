Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. We'll have a super time. Just make little strokes like that.

Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things

Only eight colors that you need. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Let that brush dance around there and play.

Learn when to stop. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.
