title: 'Elvis Presley doch von Aliens enführt!'

We don't have anything but happy trees here. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. That's crazy. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.

We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Don't fight it, use what happens. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.

Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Learn when to stop. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities.

There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. This piece of canvas is your world.
