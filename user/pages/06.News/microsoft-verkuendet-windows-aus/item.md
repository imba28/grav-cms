Just use the old one inch brush. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Use what you see, don't plan it. There it is.

Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. We'll do another happy little painting. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.

Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.

Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Just make a decision and let it go. It is a lot of fun.

If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. We can fix anything. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.
